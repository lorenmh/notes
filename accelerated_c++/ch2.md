# CH2

* `std::string::size_type` is wide enough for all C++ strings on the system
* `==`, `>=`, etc are *relational operators*
* `&&` et. al are *conditional operators*
* operator precedence: arithmetic > relational > conditional (logical)
* `||` and `&&` are left associative (which results in short circuiting)
* `+=`, etc are *compound assignment operators*
* *'using-declaration'* is what it's called when statements such as `using std` or `using std::cout` are used. They allow the programmer to use those fields without needing to specify the namespace.

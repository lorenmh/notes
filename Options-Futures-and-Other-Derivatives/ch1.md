* spot price: current price
* Futures contracts are intrinsically tied to interest rates. This is because a person can buy or sell (go long or short) with a futures contract, and then take out a loan at some point.
  - for example, if spot price is $50, interest rates are 5%, 1 year future contract price would be $52.50.
